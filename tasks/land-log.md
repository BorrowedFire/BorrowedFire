## 2026-08-04 — union-path reconcile protocol (PR #10)
- Item: schema/digest contradiction on union-merged in-place edits; fix defines a digest-only
  reconcile protocol in brain-schema.md; digest + remember defer to it.
- Class: Autonomous (docs-only live skill instructions; 3 files, +33/−14; denylist: no match).
- Gates at open: local CI parity green (skill-lint 15/15 · test-brain 22/22 · test-install 63/63);
  adversarial review, Codex, and live proof recorded on the PR before merge.
- Round 2: adversarial review (empirical two-clone git lab) validated 4 P2s in one design area →
  related-finding circuit breaker → invariant audit posted on the PR; protocol hardened once
  (precondition, Relations whitelist, both append points, retry bound, stranded-commit guard,
  no-stub rule). Core mechanics confirmed correct; no P1s. Follow-ups filed as a repo issue
  (test coverage for the protocol; template README scoping).
